A collection of some of my Aseprite scripts, with the ability to be bundled into an extension for convenience. You can use these scripts individually by downloading the files themselves, or install them bundled as an extension.

## Extension
In extension form, the scripts have extra functionality, showing up cleanly in menus instead of the scripts section. Installing these scripts as an extension is simple; just download the repo as a .zip, rename the extension to .aseprite-extension, and double-click to install.
